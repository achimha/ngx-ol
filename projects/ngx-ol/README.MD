# @achimha/ngx-ol [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/achimha/ngx-ol.svg?branch=next)](https://travis-ci.org/achimha/ngx-ol)[![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/ngx-openlayers](https://badges.gitter.im/Join%20Chat.svg)](https://gitter.im/ngx-openlayers?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)

This is based on ngx-openlayers targeting Openlayers 6 and current Angular.

It's working fine but needs some polishing around the build procedure to match the standard quality
requirements for packages.

## Demo
https://achimha.github.io/ngx-ol/

## Installation

To install this library, run:

```bash
npm install ngx-ol --save
```

## Example

Here is a "minimal" map example that fetches tiles from OpenStreetMap and center the map in Meylan (France):

```html
<aol-map [width]="'500px'" [height]="'300'">
    <aol-view [zoom]="2">
        <aol-coordinate [x]="5.795122" [y]="45.210225" [srid]="'EPSG:4326'"></aol-coordinate>
    </aol-view>
    <aol-layer-tile>
        <aol-source-osm></aol-source-osm>
    </aol-layer-tile>
</aol-map>
```
